## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow `rustfmt` configuration (see `rustfmt.toml`)
- All public functions should have doc comments
- Variable and function names in English
- UI strings go through the `i18n::tr()` system
- Keep modules focused: UI code in `qml/`, business logic in `core/`
